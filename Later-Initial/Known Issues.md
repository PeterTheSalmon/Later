When changing a fave, it is faked until the view switches

Faves may not save if the app is quit without selecting a diff. view

Fake Favourites will show when filtering by favourites only, but they will not update the favourite count, meaning they cannot trigger the show favourites only if there aren't already favourites in a given folder
