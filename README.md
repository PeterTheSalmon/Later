## Installation

Download the latest release and drag Later to your applications folder.

Trying to open the app will bring up a warning - click OK, then right-click on the app and open from there. Another warning will appear, click Open again. This process is due to Later not yet being notarized by Apple.

**Later requires macOS 12 Monterey or newer.** This is due to several new SwiftUI features only available on recent macOS versions.

Currently, updates are manual, meaning you will have to download new versions from GitHub to update.
