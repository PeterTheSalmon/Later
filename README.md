# Later

Later is a SwiftUI, macOS app to store and save links for later use!

### Why?

I was tired of Reddit's terrible post saving, and wanted an easy, convenient place to store links for _later_ use. 

### Features

- Folders
- Favourites
- Easily open and copy links
- Much more to come!

### Installation

Downoad the [lastest release](https://github.com/PeterTheSalmon/Later/releases/download/0.3.0-beta/Later.v0.3.0-beta.zip)

**Later requires macOS 12 Monterey or newer.** This is due to several new SwiftUI features only available on recent macOS versions.

Currently, updates are manual, meaning you will have to download new versions from GitHub to update.
