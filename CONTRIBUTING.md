# Contributing

I am well aware the project is somewhat of a mess, but I want to improve on this in the future. Even so, the guidelines here are pretty loose, so I would appreciate if everyone follows them.

### Reporting Bugs

- Use the issues tab here on GitHub to report bugs
- Before reporting a bug:
  - Ensure it hasn't been reported before: search through the already reported issues
    - If your bug is there, add a comment instead of posting a new one
  - Update to the latest version of Later
- Reporting:
  - Include all steps to reproduce the bug
  - Include screenshots if helpful

### Suggestions

Want to make a suggestion? Great, I appreciate it! See the following:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Describe the current behavior (if present) and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Later users if not already obvious

### Submitting Code

Check out issues to see where code help would be appreciated

- Keep code cleanish. Doesn't have to be perfect, but don't be lazy!
- Be descriptive with comments and pull requests
  - Include as much information as possible to make sure everything is clearly understood
